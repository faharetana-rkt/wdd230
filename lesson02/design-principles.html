            <p>Apple's website uses a clean and minimalist design with a clear visual hierarchy.</p>
            <p>Large, high-quality images and bold typography draw attention to key products and messages.</p>
            <p>The use of white space helps focus on individual elements.</p>

            <p>Google's search homepage is a prime example of simplicity and minimalism.</p>
            <p>The main focus is a single search bar, with no distractions or unnecessary elements.</p>
            <p>Users are presented with a clear, singular action: enter a search query.</p>
            <p>Additional options (like Google Images, News, Gmail, etc.) are available but are kept hidden initially, reducing cognitive load for users who are primarily looking to perform a search.</p>

            <p>Fitt's Law is a design principle that is more evident in the interactive elements and user interface design rather than the overall structure of a website.</p>
            <p>YouTube's homepage and video player interface exhibit this principle.</p>
